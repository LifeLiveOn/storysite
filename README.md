# LifeStories

LifeStories is a Django-based web platform dedicated to sharing personal narratives. Each user on LifeStories can contribute one comprehensive story of their life, detailing various significant events and the lessons theyâ€™ve learned. This project aims to preserve these stories as lasting memories for readers and contributors alike.

## Key Features

- **Single Story per User**: Each user can share one evolving story that includes multiple events from their life.
- **Event Updates**: Users can update their story by adding new events at any time, making their narratives dynamic and current.
- **Privacy through Cartoonification**: For users concerned about privacy, LifeStories offers an option to 'cartoonify' images associated with their stories, providing anonymity while maintaining personal expression.
- **Inclusive Storytelling**: LifeStories encourages people of all ages to share their experiences, not just those who have lived long lives. Whether you're young or old, your story matters.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Django (Python)
- **Database**: SQLite (development), PostgreSQL (production)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (Bootstrap for styling), JavaScript
- **Additional Tools**: in development... (will add Docker) to further simplify the process of deployment.
